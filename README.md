Game rules:
You can keep rolling a die and gather points until 1 shows up at which point all your accumulated points will be trashed. Make sure to hold your points 
when you feel the risk is too high to roll a die again. Holding will add your accumulated points to your total score but you will lose your turn.

The first person to reach 100 as a total score will win the game.
